    The developer saved the code to a file ({filename}) because it requires third-party libraries
    or user interaction and cannot be executed in a sandbox.
    The execution result "{execution_result}" is just confirmation that the file was written — it is NOT an error.

    Your job:
    - Review the code STATICALLY (as a code review, not based on runtime output).
    - Check if the code is logically correct and addresses all requirements of the task.
    - If during review it becomes clear that the task is missing critical information,
      set needs_clarification=true and write a clarification_question.
    - APPROVE (approved=true) if the code correctly implements the core functionality of the task, even if minor improvements could be made. Style issues, optional enhancements, and non-critical suggestions should be mentioned in feedback but must NOT block approval.
    - REJECT (approved=false) ONLY for these blocking reasons:
        1. Deprecated or removed APIs that will crash at runtime (e.g. openai.ChatCompletion.create — removed in openai>=1.0.0).
        2. A required core feature is completely missing and makes the task fail (e.g. a chatbot task with a specified persona but no system message at all).
        3. A clear logical bug that breaks the main functionality.
    - Do NOT reject for: lacking runtime output, requiring pip install, requiring env vars or API keys, minor code style issues, or non-critical enhancements.
    - Correct openai syntax (openai>=1.0.0):
          from openai import OpenAI
          client = OpenAI()
          response = client.chat.completions.create(...)

    Execution result (stdout/stderr from running the code):
    {execution_result}

    Your job:
    - Analyze whether the code correctly solves the task.
    - Check the execution result for errors, exceptions, or unexpected output.
    - If during review it becomes clear that the task is missing critical information,
      set needs_clarification=true and write a clarification_question.
    - If the code runs correctly and solves the task, set approved=true and explain why it's good.
    - If there are errors or the task is not solved, set approved=false with specific instructions to fix.
